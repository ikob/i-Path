/*
 * A note on the CPU numbering scheme used by the hwpmc(4) driver.
 *
 * CPUs are denoted using numbers in the range 0..[pmc_cpu_max()-1].
 * CPUs could be numbered "sparsely" in this range; the predicate
 * `pmc_cpu_is_present()' is used to test whether a given CPU is
 * physically present.
 *
 * Further, a CPU that is physically present may be administratively
 * disabled or otherwise unavailable for use by hwpmc(4).  The
 * `pmc_cpu_is_active()' predicate tests for CPU usability.  An
 * "active" CPU participates in thread scheduling and can field
 * interrupts raised by PMC hardware.
 *
 * On systems with hyperthreaded CPUs, multiple logical CPUs may share
 * PMC hardware resources.  For such processors one logical CPU is
 * denoted as the primary owner of the in-CPU PMC resources. The
 * pmc_cpu_is_primary() predicate is used to distinguish this primary
 * CPU from the others.
